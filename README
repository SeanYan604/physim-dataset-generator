Render physically realistic cluttered scenes using 3D CAD models and extract bounding box labels to train CNN based object detectors.

Steps to use :-
1) chose an environment : shelf, table-top, create your own (default : shelf)
2) select objects : use included models from Amazon Picking Challenge or use your own models (default : 15 APC objects)
3) number of images : input the number of images to render ( = 10)
4) install Blender and set $BLENDER_PATH in bashrc.
5) run "python generate_pictures.py".

How to :-
1) change environment : in the file "generate_pictures.py" change shelf -> table in "render_cmd" setting.
2) to use different object models : add 3D models to the folder "object_models", add the object to the list of objects in 
  "generate_pictures.py" and "simulate_and_render.py".
  
Output :-
1) generated images are present in folder "rendered_images"
2) labelled bounding boxe files for each scene <label, tl_x, tl_y, br_x, br_y>
